            Inspired by Lee&apos;s blog, where every blog post is showing the
            number of views it has, I wanted to do something similar for my
            page. I&apos;m also using Next.js 13 with the new app router but
            instead of storing the page views in a mysql database, I&apos;ll be
            using Upstash Redis. Here&apos;s an example of what we&apos;ll be
            building. Each card on the home page will show the number of views
            it has.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why Redis? Redis already comes with 2 great commands that make it
            trivial to deduplicate and to increment a counter. In order to get a
            more accurate counter, I want to debounce the incrementing of the
            counter. If a user refreshes the page, the counter should only be
            incremented once. We can do this really easily with Redis&apos; SET
            command. It has a NX option that will only set the key if it
            doesn&apos;t exist yet and an EX option that will expire the key
            after a given amount of seconds. By combining both of these options
            we can ensure a single user does not increment the counter multiple
            times within a given timeframe. The second command is INCR which
            will increment a given key by 1 atomically.
